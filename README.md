# Linear-Algebra-Notes
This repository contains my notes of Linear Algebra. This set of notes restructures the teaching sequence, making the overall framework more logical. It balances algebraic computation with geometric intuition, helping students not only achieve high scores on exams but also truly understand linear algebra.
