# Linear-Algebra-Notes
This repository contains my notes of Linear Algebra. Like Jean Dieudonné said, 'There is hardly any theory which is more elementary than linear algebra, in spite of the fact that generations of professors and textbook writers have obscured its simplicity by preposterous calculations with matrices.' This set of notes restructures the teaching sequence, making the overall framework more logical. It balances algebraic computation with geometric intuition, helping students not only achieve high scores on exams but also truly understand linear algebra.

The notes begin by introducing vectors, then move on to matrices, followed by a discussion of the relationship between the two. Subsequently, they sequentially present the three roles of a matrix: **data warehouse**, **space architect**, and **linear transformation magician**.

In the section on linear transformations, I first explain the meaning of linear transformations and their matrix representations. This is then expanded in **five** stages:

1. Extending from the standard basis to an arbitrary basis.
2. Focusing on a special type of dimension-reducing transformation: projection.
3. Generalizing from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{C}^n$.
4. Extending from square matrices to arbitrary matrices.
5. Expanding from diagonalization to the Jordan Normal Form.

Finally, the notes include a section on **matrix algebra**, a topic often omitted in most linear algebra courses or textbooks but widely useful in practice for students in fields such as economics, machine learning, and engineering.

These notes are still being updated on an irregular basis, primarily to supplement each chapter with high-quality exercises, refine certain details in the main text, and correct any typos or errors. (Currently, this set of notes is only available in Chinese; an English version will be uploaded within the next year.)
